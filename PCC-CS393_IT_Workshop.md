## Practical Syllabus
### Programming in R
* **Introduction:** R for statistics, data analysis, and machine learning; installation, help files, sessions, and R Objects (Vectors, Matrices, Lists, Data Frames). [cite: 79]
* **Programming Structures:** Control statements, loops, functions (vector and recursive). [cite: 79]
* **Data Handling:** R Packages, I/O features, data manipulation, random numbers, and statistical methods (mean, median, linear regression, normal distribution, decision tree). [cite: 80]
* **Graphics:** Creating, customizing, and saving graphs (pie charts, bar charts, histograms). [cite: 80]

### Programming in Matlab
* **Introduction & Basics:** History, strengths, MATLAB windows, basic operations, data types, and variables. [cite: 82]
* **Programming-I & II:** Vectors, matrices, built-in functions, strings, script files, function files, input/output commands. [cite: 82]
* **Conditional Statements and Loops:** Relational and logical operators, if-else, switch-case, for and while loops. [cite: 83]
* **2D & 3D Plotting:** In-built plotting functions, curve fitting, interpolation, mesh plots, and surface plots. [cite: 83]

### Programming with Python
* **Introduction:** History, features, syntax, variables, data types, and operators. [cite: 83]
* **Control Flow:** Conditional statements (if, if-else) and loops (for, while), and control statements (break, continue). [cite: 83]
* **Data Structures:** String manipulation, Lists, Tuples, and Dictionaries. [cite: 83, 84]
* **Functions & Modules:** Defining and calling functions, arguments, anonymous functions, and using modules (Math, Random). [cite: 84]
* **Exception Handling:** Handling exceptions with `try..except..finally` clauses and user-defined exceptions. [cite: 85]
